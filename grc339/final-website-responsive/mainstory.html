            <h2>Garden trends for 2020</h2>
            <p>Boho has been in for the past few years, but we’re now just starting to see a shift toward boho in outdoor spaces. As outdoor spaces themselves are starting to become more popular, and as homemakers start to ‘relax’ a bit and experiment more freely with their decor, the outdoor boho trend makes sense. Jessica Harris, Living Spaces designer, says: ‘Patterned throw pillows (botanical and tribal print) are the easiest way to bring the style – and your outdoors – to life.’Bringing the indoors out is a product of our times. The need for ‘settling in’ when we can’t travel means curating an outdoor space that’s comfortable. Outdoor bars saw a 192% increase in searches over the past six months. Outdoor kitchens saw a 106% increase over the past six months – and 5% over the year as a whole. Living Spaces designer Shelby Greene says: ‘Think of your backyard as you would your indoor space, starting with a floor plan. Arrange groups of seating, focal points, serving stations and walkways for a trendy feel.’</p>

            <p>If you live in the city and don’t have a large garden, it doesn’t mean your outdoor space can’t be styled. Searches for ‘outdoor small space furniture’ have risen by 243% over the past six months.Living Spaces Designer Gabrielle Bocanegra says: ‘Think round. Round tables, round stools… curves soften and open up a space, as opposed to harsh lines and enclosing angles.’</p>
            <p>Patio daybeds completely fit in with the ‘indoors out’ theme of 2020, so it’s no wonder they’re on the rise, with a whopping 257% over the past six months, according to Google Trends.Brynna Evans, Living Spaces Designer, says: ‘As the name suggests, position a patio daybed on a patio. Simplicity is key here, to create a calm outdoor space, so no need for a large coffee table; an end table or small pouf works just fine.’</p>

            <p>As we adapt to a new way of life that encourages social distancing, outdoor spaces will be the preferred setting for family gatherings. As such, the rise in outdoor seating trends couldn’t have come at a better time. According to Google Trends, adirondack chairs are up 303% from six months; hammocks 216% from six months; and egg chairs 189% from six months. Shelby Greene says: ‘Egg chairs are cozy, and they also happen to be sleek (or, perhaps, it’s the other way around)! Either way, they’re trending in 2020.’ Brynna Evans says: ‘In with bright colours, out with boring neutrals. Spending more time in our homes and back gardens means embracing more of our style personalities and learning to seize the present moment. What better way to do that than with splashes of fun, playful, energising colour? Neon furniture sizzles.’</p>

                        At this time of year, the lavender at the National Trust’s Hidcote is creating a haze of blue swaying gently over the silvery leaves below. Hurrying past on a warm day you catch an aromatic waft, familiar to any well-kept sock draw or pot pourri dish.
