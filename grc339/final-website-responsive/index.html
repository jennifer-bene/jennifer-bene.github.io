                     <h3>How to plant a fragrant garden </h3>
                     <p>
                        The secret to having a garden that appeals to more of your senses is to choose scented flowers that bloom at different times of the year, and give perfume at different times of the day. Right now it’s easy as there are so many different options, a huge range of scented plants are in bloom this month so you’ll be spoiled for choice, but there are also plenty of delights to be had in spring and autumn.

                     <h3>Garden lighting ideas – to illuminate your outdoor space</h3>
                     <p>
                        Gone are the days when the last rays of evening sun signalled a quick retreat indoors as the garden descended into darkness. Today, there are legions of lighting options that allow us to transform what was formerly a foreboding black space into a magical landscape, complete with colour, beams and a variety of effects, whilst also providing safe passage down steps and through pathways.

                     <p>
                        Building an extra room with a view of the garden is now a growing trend. With the current vogue for open-plan, multi-purpose family rooms that combine a mix of kitchen, dining and living spaces, garden rooms and orangeries fit the bill perfectly.

                     <p>
                        Looking for garden ideas on a slope? No garden is completely flat, unless a digger has been in and levelled the site, and, many gardens, are on a slope which when viewed at initially can be a little daunting.

                     <h3>Garden pond ideas</h3>
                     <p>
                        There are several things to think about when coming up with garden pond ideas, for example the location, shape and size should be in keeping with your gardens dimensions and style. Avoid deep shade and overhanging trees. Intended use and style will determine the size and layout of your pond, eg. Fish require a minimum capacity of 2000 litres, water features require minimum depths.
